# capsol-react
CapSol is an application for artists to upload information onto a form. The artists can input text, some media and other materials into the form. The form takes the shape of a CapSol which is then dropped on a map API and made accessable for a user to see different pop up events that the artists have going on. 
This is an ongoing project using React as a front end framework, Express for the routing and node.js in the back end. I have also used MySQL as a database. However the code is in continous iteration and therefore some parts of the technology stack will change over time.
